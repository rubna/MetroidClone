Information about level blocks is stored in this file.
Start a line with BLOCK to start a level block.
Then, specify the exits. Use up to four letters for this. U if there's an exit above, D if there's an exit below, L if there's an exit to the left,
R if there's an exit to the right.
Then, use the next lines to specify the block. Use a dot for an empty position. Use a 1 for a block. Use a 2 (only on the sides) for a block that can
be removed if there's an exit or if there are two blocks above each other.
For exits, always make sure at least the middle block is reachable.
